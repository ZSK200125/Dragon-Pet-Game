# Virtual Pet Dragon Game

**Virtual Pet Dragon** is a text-based nurturing game where you raise your very own dragon!  
Choose your dragon’s name and color, then take care of its health, mood, and experience through daily activities like feeding, training, adventuring, and using special skills.

The game is synced with real-world days — your dragon's stats will decay each day, so you must keep up with daily care.  
Your goal: Reach Level 4 with 100 Health and 100 Mood to win!

But be careful — if either Health or Mood drops to zero, the game is over.

This game is designed for fans of virtual pet games, especially those who are new to text-based or minimal interface experiences. Dive in and enjoy the challenge of nurturing your dragon!
